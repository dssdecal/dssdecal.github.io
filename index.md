## Data 198: Introduction to Real World Data Science

The Introduction to Real-World Data Science DeCal, offered by the [Data Science Society at Berkeley](https://www.dssberkeley.org/), 
is a semester-long course focused on hands-on, project-based learning. 
Unlike traditional classes, this course gives students full creative control over a data science 
project of their choosing, allowing them to collaborate and apply key concepts in real-world scenarios. 
Guided by mentorship from committee members, students will navigate the entire data science lifecycle -- from crafting a project proposal and performing exploratory data analysis, to engineering and evaluating machine learning models.
