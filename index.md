## Data 198: Introduction to Real World Data Science

The Introduction to Real-World Data Science DeCal, offered by the <a href="https://www.dssberkeley.org/" target="_blank" style="color:rgb(91, 164, 140); text-decoration: none;">Data Science Society at Berkeley</a>, 
is a semester-long course focused on hands-on, project-based learning. 
Unlike traditional classes, this course gives students full creative control over a data science 
project of their choosing, allowing them to collaborate and apply key concepts in real-world scenarios. 
Guided by mentorship from committee members, students will navigate the entire data science lifecycle -- from crafting a project proposal and performing exploratory data analysis, to engineering and evaluating machine learning models.
